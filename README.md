# Booth_Multiplier
Booth _multiplier code is made on verilog and its timing diagram has been verified on Iverilog software. Here this hardware implementation of Booth multiplier multiplies N(variable) bit no. (which can changed through the code by putting the value of N) and provide the result in two N bit Registers A and Q in which A is MSB(8bits)
